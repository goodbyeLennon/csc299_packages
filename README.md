# csc299_packages

This is a collection of the packages required for CSC299 Fall 2017 - Blockchains and Smart Contracts

It is adapted from the Vagrantfile posted on the course website. It is meant to be run in an existing
Ubuntu installation. The script will attempt to download and install all the necessary packages.

You can run the script at the terminal in Ubuntu by navigating to the directory where the script is
saved and entering the command

sudo bash ./install_csc299.sh

You will need to enter your password.

So, for example, if you have the file saved in a directory called

/usr/scripts/csc299/

You can enter into the terminal

cd /usr/scripts/csc299

sudo bash ./install_csc299.sh

And it should run the script.
Alternately, if you don't want to navigate to the directory, you could just type

sudo bash /usr/scripts/csc299/install_csc299.sh
